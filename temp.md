❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a+b;}
```

Issues:
* ✘ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function. The function needs to accept arguments.
* ✘ Missing JSDoc comment.

✅ Recommended Fix:
```javascript
/**
* Calculates the sum of two numbers.
* @param {number} a - The first number.
* @param {number} b - The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
*/
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

Improvements:
* ✔ Function now accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, allowing it to calculate the sum of any two numbers passed to it.
* ✔ Added a JSDoc comment to clearly document the function's purpose, parameters, and return value. This improves code
readability and maintainability.
